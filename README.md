## Overview

Prooph Event Store Client supports async non-blocking communication via TCP to [EventStore](https://eventstore.org/).
In the future, there will be also a server implementation written in pure PHP using Postgres (maybe also MySQL) as backend.

Asynchronous operations are done via [Amp](https://amphp.org/) and sync operation are also supported.

You don't need any extra extensions, however it's recommended to install [uv](https://pecl.php.net/package/uv) and [protobuf](https://pecl.php.net/package/protobuf).
